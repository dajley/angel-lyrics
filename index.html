        Do you ever make it out of your head?
        Do you still swim in your thoughts?
        Do you still mistake your flaws for property?
        Something that just don't sit right with you
        But Heaven knows, Heaven knows
        Your wings can't weight you down
        Angels make a way somehow
        And if we fall, we fall on clouds
        Black girl here, black girl with the black girl hair
        Took a little sunkiss just to look like this
        God sent, you're an angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Heaven wears your halo
        They know you're an angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        I'm a big deal
        I get sick and tired of holdin' it in
        Rich blood, you can probably see the gold in my skin
        I'm more than a girl, won't let the troubles of the world
        Come weigh me down
        But angels make a way somehow
        And if we fall, we fall on clouds
        Black girl here, black girl with the black girl hair
        Took a little sunkiss just to look like this
        God sent, you're an angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Heaven wears your halo
        They know you're an angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Some might hate and they wait on your fall (oh)
        They don't know there's a grace for it all (oh)
        My flaws don't make me
        Beautiful and real, all you fake cannot compare
        Oh, you're perfectly a masterpiece
        And all of me, even my scars
        Even my scars, yeah
        Black girl here, black girl with the black girl hair
        Took a little sunkiss just to look like this
        God sent, you're an angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Heaven wears your halo
        They know you're an angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
        Angel (angel)
